      <p>  I fully understand, that what I've learned is much much less,  what remains to be learned yet.  </p>

  <li>The picture you see is a black swan, which has a strong simbolic meaning for me. </li>
  <li> There is a book titled <b> Black swan </b>, where is said, that<b> always something unexpectedly happens in our lives</b>, so giving advice always to be ready.</li>
     <li> I think, that this phrase has a strong connection to the slogan, which I've choosen as a my life's charter. </li>
     <li> P.S.This is the only way to go forward. </li>

 </ol>  <li> In this is way </li> <li> I write one another  </li> <li> under the previous list </li>  </ol>
